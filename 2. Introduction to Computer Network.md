# Unit 01 - Introduction to - Computer Network

# What is Computer Network?
A computer network is a group of two or more interconnected computer systems. You can establish a network connection using either cable or wireless media. 
# Overview of computer network 	
* Computer networking or data communication is a most important part of the information technology.
* Today every business in the world needs a computer network for smooth operations, instant communication and data access.
* A computer network is comprised of connectivity devices and components and software, to share data and resources between two or more computers.
* The key devices involved that make the infrastructure of a computer network are Hub, Switch, Router, Modem, Access point, LAN card and network cables.

# Types of Computer Network
There are different types of a computer network such as LAN, MAN, WAN and wireless network. 
## LAN
LAN stands for local area network and a network in a room, in a building or a network over small distance is known as a LAN.
## MAN
MAN stands for Metropolitan area network and it covers the networking between two offices within the city. 
## WAN
WAN stands for wide area network and it cover the networking between two or more computers between two cities, two countries or two continents.
## Wireless Aetwork
Wireless network is generally span in limited area like house or building. But sometime using special hardware it can span on very large area.
# Usage of computer network
* Network help us to connect multiple computer together to send and receive information from one computer to another.
* Network helps you to share common services like printer, scanner etc.
* Can be used to send/receive emails
* Usage of computer network
* The best example of computer network is the Internet.
* Now a days network is used everywhere from home to multinational companies to run the daily task and functioning.
# Network Categories
A computer networks communication can be categorized into main three categories.
* Centralized Network
* Distributed Network
* Collaborative computing. 
## Centralized Network
* It is also known as client-server computing. 
* In this type of system, multiple computers are joined to one powerful mainframe computer.
* The server or mainframe computer has huge storage and processing capabilities.
• The computers that are connected to the mainframe or server are called Clients or Nodes.
• These nodes are not connected to each other; they are only connected to server.
### Advantages
* Reduced costs: it is necessary to have just one warehouse as center instead of having lots of warehouse which reduce the costs.
* Equipment: less stuff, materials and furniture in one warehouse than in more than one
* Simplicity: having a centralized distribution network simplifies the inventory management. Easy to control the inventory and correct the possible mistakes.
### Disadvantage
* Single point of failure

## Distributed Network
* If one computer can forcibly start, stop or control another the computers are not autonomous. A system with one control unit and many slaves, or a large computer with remote printers and terminals is not called a computer network, it is called a Distributed System.
* Distributed computing means that the task is divided among multiple computers.
* Distributed computing interconnects one ore more personal computers or Workstations.
* In distributed computing, the nodes are capable of processing their own data and rely on network for services other than data processing.

### Advantages
* Reliability : One system crash does not affect the network
* Scalability: Easy scale system and add more nodes
* High Performance: Can provide high performance (distributed computing / calculation)

### Disadvantages
* Difficult troubleshooting: Troubleshooting faults can be difficult
* High Cost
* Security Issues

## Collaborative / Hybrid Network
* It is the combination of centralized and distributed computing.
* In collaborative computing, the nodes are able to serve the basic needs of their users but they are dependent on some other computers for processing some specific request.

# Line Configuration
Line configuration refers to the way two or more communication devices attached to a link.
A Link is the physical communication pathway that transfers data from one device to another.
For communication to occur, two devices must be connected in same way to the same link at the same time.

Line Configuration
There are two possible line configurations.       1. Point-to-Point.       2. Multipoint.
